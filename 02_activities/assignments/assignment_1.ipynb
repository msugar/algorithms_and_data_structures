    "To understand how this code finds all paths from the root to any leaf in a tree, imagine you're at the entrance of a maze with no exits and you want to map all the paths from the entrance to any dead end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main function bt_path starts by handling an empty tree - if there's no tree, there are no paths, so it returns an empty list.\n",
    "The real work happens in the helper function visit. Think of it like exploring with a piece of string - you tie the string at the entrance and unroll it as you walk:\n",
    "1. When you reach a new room (node), you add its number to your current path (current_path.append).\n",
    "2. Then you check: If it's a dead end (leaf node), you've found a complete path! Make a copy of your current path and save it. If not, explore any available doorways - first left, then right - taking your string with you.\n",
    "3. After exploring all possibilities from this room, you step back (backtrack) by removing this room's number from your path (current_path.pop). This is like rewinding your string to try a different route.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clever part is the backtracking - by removing each room number as we step back, we keep our path accurate for exploring other routes. We're reusing the same path list instead of making new ones for every possible route.\n",
    "At the end, we have a list of all possible paths from entrance to every dead end in our maze.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "     1\n",
    "    / \\\n",
    "   2   3\n",
    "  /     \\\n",
    " 4       5\n",
    "```\n",

    "1. Go left to 4: `[1,2,4]`\n",

    "Here is an alternative approach using a generator, which is more memory-friendly. Think of it like writing directions for exploring a building, but instead of writing down all paths at once, you guide someone through one complete path at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the thinking:\n",
    "1. Instead of collecting all paths in a list, we'll \"yield\" each path as we find it\n",
    "2. Think of \"yield\" like saying \"here's one path I found\" before continuing to look for more\n",
    "3. The person following our directions can deal with each path as it's found, rather than waiting for all of them\n",
    "\n",
    "The big difference is:\n",
    "- Original solution: Like taking photos of every possible path and giving someone the whole photo album at the end\n",
    "- Generator solution: Like walking with someone and pointing out each complete path as you discover it\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages:\n",
    "- Uses less memory because you only keep track of the current path you're exploring\n",
    "- Good for huge trees where storing all paths at once would be too much\n",
    "- The person using our code can start processing paths immediately, without waiting for all of them\n",
    "\n",
    "The trade-off:\n",
    "- You can only look at each path once as it's generated (unless you save them yourself)\n",
    "- Can't know how many paths there are until you've seen them all\n",
    "\n",
    "It's like the difference between:\n",
    "- Writing down all the ways to get through a maze, then giving someone the complete list\n",
    "- Walking through the maze with someone and telling them \"here's one way!\" each time you find an exit, then backtracking to find more\n",
    "\n",
    "For our classmates: When coding this up, you'll use Python's `yield` keyword instead of building a list. Each time you find a leaf node, instead of appending to a list, you'll `yield` that path. The rest of the logic stays pretty similar!"
