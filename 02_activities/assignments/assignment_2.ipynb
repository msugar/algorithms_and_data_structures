    "### Explanation of my partner's solution\n",
    "My partner's solution fails to produce the right results if the input is a list with just one value, or a list where all the values are the same, when that value is greater than zero. It also deviates from the original requirements because it assumes the list could have negative values, while the problem says clearly it should contain only values in the [0, n] range.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Empty list check:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    if not nums:\n",
    "        return [-1]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This handles the edge case of an empty list. This is good defensive programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Converting to set:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    nums_set = set(nums)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This is clever because:\n",
    "    - It removes duplicates automatically\n",
    "    - Lookups in a set are O(1), making the solution more efficient\n",
    "    - It makes the code cleaner to read\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Finding the range:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    lower_range = min(nums_set)\n",
    "    upper_range = max(nums_set)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Here's where the solution deviates from the requirements:\n",
    "    - The original problem states we work with range [0, n]\n",
    "    - Therefore, lower_range should always be 0\n",
    "    - This solution assumes we might have negative numbers, which isn't part of the requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "    It's also a bug, because it doesn't work for input lists containing just one element (when its value is greater than 0), or when all elements are of the same value (again, for values greater than 0). \n",
    "    - For example: `missingNumber([10])` should return `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, but my partner's code incorrectly returns `[-1]` instead.\n",
    "    - The problem is that `lower_range`  and `upper_range` are set to the same value under those circumstances, making `range(lower_range, upper_range + 1)` an empty range.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finding missing numbers:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    missing_numbers = [number for number in range(lower_range, upper_range + 1) if number not in nums_set]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This line:\n",
    "    - Uses a list comprehension to find all missing numbers\n",
    "    - Checks each number in the range against our set\n",
    "    - Creates a list of numbers that should be there but aren't\n",
    "    - As mentioned above, it doesn't gives the correct results when the input list has one value or all elements are of the same value, when that value is greater than 0.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. Return logic:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    return missing_numbers if missing_numbers else [-1]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This follows the requirement to return -1 (though as a list [-1]) when no numbers are missing. But it fails to produce the correct results in the cases mentioned above."

    "First, it demonstrated how crucial it is to fully understand the problem requirements. My partner's solution was technically sound and showed good programming practices (using sets for efficiency, handling empty inputs, clean code structure), but it fundamentally misinterpreted the problem's range requirement. This is a common pitfall in both academic and real-world programming â€“ we can write elegant code that solves the wrong problem!\n",

    "The complexity analysis discussion was particularly interesting. While my partner provided a detailed analysis, breaking it down into simpler terms (using just k and n) made it much clearer. This reinforced the importance of clear communication in technical discussions.\n",

    "Testing edge cases proved invaluable. The cases [10] and [2,2,2] exposed the core issue in the solution's logic. This reminded me that in algorithm problems, it's not enough to test typical cases â€“ we need to consider boundary conditions and \"unexpected\" inputs.\n",
